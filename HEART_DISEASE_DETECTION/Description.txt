Heart disease prediction

DESCRIPTION
Our machine learning model in python can be used in predicting heart diseases prediction.
Prediction of Heart Diseases is achieved using ML based Support Vector Machine Algorithm with heart dataset implemented in python.
We have also done data cleaning, data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis in our file to get a clear view for heart diseases prediction.

Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fAO9_fXsrJLeeRpi68EPx4LmNOPTm25O/view?usp=sharing

Totally we have 14 columns in this dataset which contains:
1.Age
2.Sex
3. pain type (4 values)
4.Resting blood pressure
5.Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6.Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7.Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8.Maximum heart rate achieved
9.exercise induced angina
10.Oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11.The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. of major vessels (0-3) coloured by fluoroscopy
13.Thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect
14. This is Target column which contains value as 0 and 1. 0 represents person as healthy and 1 represents person has heart disease.

Important libraries used: 
1.	Numpy
2.	Pandas
3.	Sklearn
Training model: Logistics regression 
This this binary classification project hence we used logistic regression model for prediction .

For testing accuracy and performance we used following algorithms:
1.	Linear regression
2.	KNN
3.	Logistic regression
4.	Random forest
